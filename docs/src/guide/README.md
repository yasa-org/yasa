# Introduction

YASA - Yet Another Solr Admin is a project that aims to serve as an alternative to Solr's old admin UI.

The project contains some new features and support for most of the current admin's features.
YASA is written in Vue, instead of Solr's old admin UI that is written in angularJS. 
We've decided to write the new project in Vue since it has great community support and is more flexible. 

The project uses Apache Echarts, Monaco Editor, and more in order to improve Solr's user experience.
